## Plan: Add Texas Southern, Jackson State, and Arkansas Pine Bluff to SWAC

### Overview
Add three new SWAC D1 schools with significantly harder standards than Alabama A&M, with each school having unique (but similar) standards.

### File to Modify
`src/data/schoolStandards.ts` - Add new entries after Prairie View A&M (around line 29186)

### School Details

| Field | Texas Southern | Jackson State | Arkansas Pine Bluff |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| id | swac_texas_southern | swac_jackson_state | swac_arkansas_pine_bluff |
| state | TX | MS | AR |
| searchKeywords | "texas southern", "tsu", "tigers" | "jackson state", "jsu", "tigers" | "arkansas pine bluff", "uapb", "golden lions" |

### Standards Strategy
- Make standards approximately 0.30-0.35 seconds faster for sprints than Alabama A&M
- Apply proportional improvements across all events
- Each school gets slightly different values (1-3 hundredths difference for sprints)

### Technical Implementation
- Insert 3 new entries after Prairie View A&M (line 29186)
- Texas Southern has the hardest standards (closest to elite programs)
- Jackson State slightly easier than Texas Southern
- Arkansas Pine Bluff slightly easier than Jackson State
- No `hasOfficialStandards` flag since these are estimates
- Include all events that Alabama A&M has (17 events per gender)
