## Plan: Add 10 CACC Schools Using East Tennessee State Standards

### Overview
Add 10 Central Atlantic Collegiate Conference (CACC) schools to `src/data/schoolStandards.ts` using East Tennessee State University standards as the baseline, with slight variations ranked from best (Goldey-Beacom) to worst (Chestnut Hill). Since these are D2 schools and the differences should be subtle, offsets will be small -- approximately 0.02-0.04s per tier for sprints, scaling proportionally for other events.

### File to Modify
`src/data/schoolStandards.ts` -- Create a new `caccSchools` array after the NACC section (after line 32003), and push it to the main array.

### School Details (ranked top to bottom)

| Rank | School | ID | State | Search Keywords |
|------|--------|----|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Goldey-Beacom College | cacc_goldey_beacom | DE | "goldey-beacom", "goldey beacom", "gbc", "lightning" |
| 2 | Georgian Court University | cacc_georgian_court | NJ | "georgian court", "gcu", "lions" |

| 4 | Wilmington University | cacc_wilmington_de | DE | "wilmington", "wilmington university", "wildcats", "delaware" |
| 5 | Felician University | cacc_felician | NJ | "felician", "golden falcons" |
| 6 | Caldwell University | cacc_caldwell | NJ | "caldwell", "cougars" |
| 7 | Thomas Jefferson University | cacc_jefferson | PA | "jefferson", "thomas jefferson", "rams" |
| 8 | Dominican College | cacc_dominican_ny | NY | "dominican", "dominican college", "chargers", "new york" |
| 9 | University of Bridgeport | cacc_bridgeport | CT | "bridgeport", "purple knights" |
| 10 | Chestnut Hill College | cacc_chestnut_hill | PA | "chestnut hill", "griffins" |

### Variation Strategy
- All schools use ETSU as the baseline with the same event set (including 300m Hurdles, Decathlon/Heptathlon)
- Rank 1 (Goldey-Beacom): Matches ETSU exactly or very close
- Each subsequent school gets slightly slower/shorter -- approximately 0.02-0.04s per rank for sprints
- Total range from top to bottom is small (about 0.20-0.35s for sprints, 2-5s for distance, 1-3 feet for field)
- Division: D2, Conference: CACC

### Technical Implementation
- Create a new `const caccSchools: SchoolStandards[]` array after line 32003 (after the NACC closing bracket)
- Add `schoolStandards.push(...caccSchools);` after the array definition
- Each school uses the full ETSU event set including 300m Hurdles, Decathlon (men), and Heptathlon (women)
- Division: D2, Conference: CACC
- Uses `maleStandards` and `femaleStandards` property names
- Consistent small offsets (0.02s sprints, 0.20s mid-distance, 0.40s 1500m+, 2s 5K, 5s 10K, 1" field per rank)

### Competitive Positioning Summary
- **Goldey-Beacom** (top): Matches ETSU baseline exactly -- strongest CACC program
- **Georgian Court through Felician** (2-5): Very slight drop-offs, still highly competitive
- **Caldwell through Bridgeport** (6-9): Moderate drop-offs, solid mid-tier programs
- **Chestnut Hill** (10): Most accessible -- about 0.18s slower in 100m, ~18s slower in 5K vs top
