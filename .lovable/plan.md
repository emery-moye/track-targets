## Plan: Add Five SWAC Schools Based on Bethune-Cookman Standards

### Overview
Add Florida A&M, Alcorn State, Southern University, Grambling State, and Alabama State to the SWAC conference using Bethune-Cookman's official standards as a baseline with slight variations to make each school unique.

### File to Modify
`src/data/schoolStandards.ts` - Add new entries after Bethune-Cookman (line 29374)

### School Details

| Field | Florida A&M | Alcorn State | Southern | Grambling | Alabama State |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| id | swac_florida_am | swac_alcorn_state | swac_southern | swac_grambling | swac_alabama_state |
| state | FL | MS | LA | LA | AL |
| searchKeywords | "florida am", "famu", "rattlers" | "alcorn state", "alcorn", "braves" | "southern", "southern university", "jaguars" | "grambling", "gsu", "tigers" | "alabama state", "asu", "hornets" |

### Variation Strategy
Each school will have slightly different standards (0.02-0.10 seconds for sprints, proportional for other events):
- **Florida A&M**: Slightly harder than BCU (-0.03 to -0.05s for sprints)
- **Alcorn State**: Very similar to BCU (+0.02 to +0.05s for sprints)
- **Southern**: Slightly easier than BCU (+0.05 to +0.08s for sprints)
- **Grambling**: Comparable to BCU (-0.02 to +0.03s for sprints)
- **Alabama State**: Between BCU and Southern (+0.03 to +0.06s for sprints)

### Technical Implementation
- Insert 5 new entries after Bethune-Cookman (line 29374)
- All schools use the same 19 men's events and 18 women's events as BCU
- No `hasOfficialStandards` flag since these are estimates based on BCU
- Each school has unique standards with slight variations from BCU
