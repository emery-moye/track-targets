## Plan: Add 7 Conference of New England (CCC) Schools

### Overview
Add 7 schools from the Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC) / Conference of New England to `src/data/schoolStandards.ts` using East Stroudsburg University standards as the baseline, with very small variations ranked from best (Hartford) to worst (Nichols). These are D3 schools.

### File to Modify
`src/data/schoolStandards.ts` -- Create a new `cneSchools` array after line 32554 (after the CACC push statement), and push it to the main array.

### School Details (ranked top to bottom)

| Rank | School | ID | State | Division | Search Keywords |
|------|--------|----|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | University of Hartford | cne_hartford | CT | D3 | "hartford", "hawks", "connecticut" |
| 2 | Roger Williams University | cne_roger_williams | RI | D3 | "roger williams", "rwu", "hawks", "rhode island" |
| 3 | Gordon College | cne_gordon | MA | D3 | "gordon", "fighting scots", "massachusetts" |
| 4 | Wentworth Institute of Technology | cne_wentworth | MA | D3 | "wentworth", "wit", "leopards" |
| 5 | Suffolk University | cne_suffolk | MA | D3 | "suffolk", "rams", "boston" |
| 6 | Western New England University | cne_western_ne | MA | D3 | "western new england", "wne", "golden bears" |
| 7 | Nichols College | cne_nichols | MA | D3 | "nichols", "bison" |

### Variation Strategy
- Very small offsets per rank since user wants them "not that much different"
- Sprints: ~0.02s per rank (total range ~0.12s from top to bottom)
- Mid-distance (800m): ~0.15s per rank
- Distance (1500m-5000m): ~0.30-1.5s per rank
- Field events: ~1" per rank for jumps, ~1' per rank for throws
- Multi-events (Decathlon/Heptathlon): ~15 points per rank

### Men's Standards (Target / Recruit / Walk-on)

East Stroudsburg baseline for reference: 100m 11.15/11.45/11.75, 200m 22.70/23.20/23.70, 400m 50.30/51.30/52.30, etc.

### Technical Implementation
- Create a new `const cneSchools: SchoolStandards[]` array after line 32554
- Add `schoolStandards.push(...cneSchools);` after the array
- Conference name: "CCC" (Commonwealth Coast Conference, commonly called Conference of New England)
- Division: D3
- Uses the same event set as East Stroudsburg (20 events per gender including 300m Hurdles, Decathlon/Heptathlon)
- Very tight variations: ~0.12s total range for sprints, ~1.80s for 1500m, ~9' for throws from top to bottom
